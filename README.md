# HuffmanImplementation
This implementation of the Huffman Algorithm is in c++. 
There is an encoding implementation that takes in files, encodes them, creates a file to save the encoded text as well as a dictionary to use when decoding. 
The decoding implementation takes the encoded file and the dictionary and prints out the original file.

Note1: Takes in only text files and prints out only text files.
Note2: Originally made totakein Base64 text.
