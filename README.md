# HuffmanImplementation
This implementation of the Huffman Algorithm is in c++. There is an encoding implementation that takes in files, encodes them, creates a file to save the encoded text as well as a dictionary to use when decoding. The decoding implementation takes the encoded file and the dictionary and prints out the original file.
